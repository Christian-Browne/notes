# MVC

### View

- What the user sees
- HTML would be the view

### Model

- Data needed by the view
- View is a skeleton, it needs data to be meaningful

### Controller

- Glues the model and view together
- Takes the data from model and sends it to the view
- Handles every web request

`/grades` endpoint

- Controller fetches frontend server from server
- Fronend will handle fetching data from whatever endpoint client hit.
- Will use JavaScript to fetch data from `/grades` endpoint you built in Java
